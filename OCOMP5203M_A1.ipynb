        "The basic principle of our image-to-text model is as pictured in the diagram below, where an Encoder network encodes the input image as a feature vector by providing the outputs of the last fully-connected layer of a pre-trained CNN (we use [ResNet-152](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)). This pretrained network has been trained on the complete ImageNet dataset and is thus able to recognise common objects. \n",

As the image feature dimensions are large and sparse, the Decoder network includes a linear layer which downsizes them, followed by a batch normalisation layer to speed up training. Those resulting features, as well as the reference text captions, are passed into a recurrent network (we will use an RNN). \n",
