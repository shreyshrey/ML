        "The basic principle of our image-to-text model is as pictured in the diagram below, where an Encoder network encodes the input image as a feature vector by providing the outputs of the last fully-connected layer of a pre-trained CNN (we use [ResNet-152](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)). This pretrained network has been trained on the complete ImageNet dataset and is thus able to recognise common objects. \n",

        "These features are then fed into a Decoder network along with the reference captions. As the image feature dimensions are large and sparse, the Decoder network includes a linear layer which downsizes them, followed by a batch normalisation layer to speed up training. Those resulting features, as well as the reference text captions, are passed into a recurrent network (we will use an RNN). \n",
